    <h1 class="coffee">How To Make A Coffee</h1>

    <h4>How to brew a cup of paradise(joe) using a French Press</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Measure your coffee. The standard ratio is approximately 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water. Don’t be afraid to add a few extra beans to be on the safe side – you can more approximately measure out your coffee using a scale after it’s ground.</li>
        <li>Grind your coffee. Alright, this is where the coffee-making process really begins. Go for a finer roast if you want a sweeter cup of coffee, or a coarser grind if you’re aiming for a satisfying, weighty bitter. Make sure the grinder is clean before using, then feel free to press the magic button.</li>
        <li>Prepare the water. You’ll want to prepare the water last, to ensure the water is the temperature you’re aiming for. Pour from the filter, and let the water sit off from the boil for about 30 seconds before immersing your coffee grounds in the French Press.</li>
        <li>Pour. Saturate the grounds evenly with a smooth, steady pour that will agitate the coffee grounds. Do not put the lid on top of the brewer just yet.</li>
        <li>Soak and stir. Let the grounds absorb the water for approximately 30 seconds before stirring – a few gentle motions using the back of a spoon around the top layer of the mixture and along the sides, to immerse any grounds that are stuck.</li>
        <li>Brew. Let the water extract from the grounds for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Less than that, and you’ll find your coffee may be too sweet or even sour. Any longer, and your coffee will be over-extracted and unappetizingly bitter – so, set a timer.</li>
        <li>Plunge. There really is no wrong way to push here – just a simple, even push-through of the filter down to the bottom. However, it’s not a clogged toilet – don’t exert too much force or, of course, your coffee will splash. Or you may break the machine, if it’s glass.</li>
        <li>Pour. Word to the wise: The flavor notes of your coffee will change as the cup cools. If at first you’re not tasting what was intended, let it continue to setup. What you taste when it’s piping hot is not what you’ll taste when it’s cooled to a lukewarm temperature.</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Basic steps to make perfect coffee:</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Line the basket of your coffee maker with a filter. Grind coffee beans to medium or medium-fine grind size. Bring filtered water to a boil, then let it sit for a minute.</li>
    <li>Pour enough water into the filter to wet it completely, and let it drain into your cup or coffee pot. Discard the water.</li>
    <li>Measure the ground coffee into the wet filter. Pour in enough water to wet the ground beans and drain into your cup or coffee pot, then pour in the rest of the water,</li>
    </ol>
